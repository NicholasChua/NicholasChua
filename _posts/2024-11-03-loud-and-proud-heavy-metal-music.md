# Loud and Proud: Heavy Metal Music

## A Surprise to Many

Whenever someone learns that I am a fan of heavy metal music, they are often surprised. Maybe one day people will learn not to assume things about me based on their first impressions of me (like my [vasectomy]({% link _posts/2024-09-03-sterile-by-design.md %})). Still, I don't blame them. I don't have the tattooes, piercings, or long hair that are often associated with heavy metal fans. It is always funny watching someone learn unexpected things about me.

## How it All Began

My first exposure to metal was listening to a stranger's recommendation and being plunged head-first into the deep end of the pool with Scar Symmetry, specifically the track ["Ghost Prototype I - Measurement of Thought"][1] from their album "Holographic Universe". I was shocked that such music existed and how I had never heard of it before. I like to joke that, due to my first exposure being something so heavy, I could never find anything other than metal enjoyable. And that remains true to this day! I have tried to listen to other genres, but without that heaviness that I was used to, I just couldn't get into it.

Besides, have you seen the album art for metal bands? That is the finishing touch that completes the entire package. I think it recognizes that a complete experience is not just about the music, but also the visuals that accompany its first impression.

## What Sub-genres do I Listen to?

While I pretty much enjoy almost all sub-genres of metal, my main three are folk, power, and black metal. Why those three? A common theme in all three is that they tell stories in unique ways, with vastly different presentations.

Folk metal tells a story using both traditional and modern instruments, tinged with the culture of the band's origin. Being from Asia, it is always interesting to learn about cultures and stories from other parts of the world (primarily European) through an unlikely medium. 

Power metal tells a story, focusing mainly on fictional stories, with powerful vocals and fast-paced instrumentals. It is like listening to a fantasy novel, but with a soundtrack that makes it feel like you are in the deep of the action.

Black metal tells a raw, unfiltered story, not shying away from the darker aspects of life. Sometimes, this is done without lyrics, letting the instruments tell the story. How the [Early Norwegian Black Metal Scene][2] came about is also a fascinating story in itself.

## Examples of Music I Listen to

For each genre, I have chosen two songs that I listen to regularly and think are good representations of the genre.

### Folk Metal

Ask any avid metal fan about folk metal, and they will likely mention Eluveitie. Their song ["The Call of The Mountains"][3] is a great example of how folk metal can blend traditional instruments with modern ones.

Another band that I enjoy is Lyrre, fronted by Michalina Malisz, who played the hurdy-gurdy for Eluveitie and now has her band. Their song ["Call in the Wind"][4] is a great example of how such unique instruments can feel at home in metal.

### Power Metal

Unleash the Archers has been present in the power metal scene for a while now, and their "Apex" album represented a significant evolution in sound for the better. Their song ["Awakening"][5] is a great example of how power metal steps on the gas and rarely lets up.

Kamelot is a cult classic in the power metal scene, with their song ["The Haunting"][6] displaying the emotional depth that power metal conveys through its storytelling.

### Black Metal

Wolves in the Throne Room has been a staple in the black metal scene for a while now, and their song ["Mountain Magick"][7] shows how black metal can express the raw, unfiltered power of nature through music.

A lesser-known band that I also enjoy is Путь, a Russian black metal band. Their song ["Так пела метель"][8] (roughly translated to "How the Blizzard Sang") is a great example of how the chugging guitars and blast beats can co-exist with the accordion in a unique presentation. I know there are some Russian readers out there, so I hope you enjoy this one!

### Other Genres

While I mainly listen to these three genres, I think it would be remiss of me not to mention Bell Witch's ["Mirror Reaper"][9]. It is a unique 83-minute long slow experience of a totality of grief, a tribute to their late drummer, Adrian Guerra. It is a story told through a unique presentation that makes every second worth listening to.

## Conclusion

I hope this post has given you some insight into one of the pillars of my life. I have always been appreciative of the medium of music to tell stories in unique ways, and the heaviness brings a catharsis that I have not found in other genres. I hope you have found something new to listen to, and if you have any recommendations for me, I am all ears!
