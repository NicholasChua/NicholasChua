# The Virtual World and the Real World

## Background

Those who know me well know that I am an avid gamer. I have been playing video games since I was a child, and it has influenced my love for computing and technology. Particularly, I am a fan of role-playing games (RPGs), whose virtual worlds have captivated me with their stories and characters.

## My Beginnings

It was hard to pinpoint which exactly was my first game, but I remember at least that my first gaming platform was the iMac G3. I remember that there were some games that had already been installed on it, including a suite of games from [Ambrosia Software][1]. I remember playing games like *Apeiron*, *Escape Velocity*, *Cythera*, amongst others. At a young age, I was already captivated by the gameplay, although I did not understand the stories that were being told.

I remember that I was particularly captivated by the world of Cythera, a game which casts you as the legendary saviour of a dying king. While I had never come close to finishing the game, I remember the sense of wonder and exploration that the game offered, and how it shaped my preferences for games that offered a rich story and world to explore.

## An Eight Year Addiction

When I was 12, I remember seeing a copy of *World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade* in a store. I had never heard of it before, but the concept of a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) intrigued me. I remember begging my parents to buy it for me, and they relented. Little did I know that this game would consume the next eight years of my life.

The world of Azeroth was vast and beautiful, and I remember playing for many hours after school, even to the detriment of my studies. I remember playing an undead warlock, and the various friends I had made along the way. I remember how I would spend hours completing quests, hunting achievements, joining dungeons and raids, and generally having a good time.

## The Real World

Whether I liked it or not, I had to stop playing regularly when it was time for my National Service in 2015, where male citizens of Singapore are conscripted into the military for two years. I remember that I had to give up my account, as I knew that I would not have the time to play. It was a bittersweet moment, as I had to say goodbye to a game that had been a big part of my life. Yet, even though I left behind [World of Warcraft][3], I still carried with me the memories and experiences that I had gained from the game.

## Other Role-Playing Games

I did not just play World of Warcraft exclusively. I remember also playing other games like [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim][4], [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt][5]. Each of these games offered a unique experience, and I remember being captivated by the stories and characters that they offered. I remember the sense of wonder and exploration that I felt when I played these games, and how they helped me to escape from the real world, if only for a little while.

To this day, I still believe The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to be one of the best games I have ever played. I had played the second instalment of the series before this, and I was already a fan. The third was an absolute masterpiece, especially the expansion Hearts of Stone, which I believe was one of the best expansions ever made.

## The Value of Gaming

I believe that gaming has absolutely contributed to my life positively. I had never had any trouble with my English in school, and I believe that it was because of the games that I played. I had to read a lot of text in games, and I believe that it helped me to improve my vocabulary and comprehension. I also believe that gaming has helped me to develop my problem-solving skills, as many games require you to think critically and strategically to overcome challenges. Most importantly, I believe that gaming has helped me to develop my creativity, as many games offer you the freedom to explore and create your own stories and experiences.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I believe that gaming has shaped me in so many ways. It has truly helped me to understand and appreciate the value of storytelling, and how it can be used to create immersive and engaging experiences. It has also helped me to appreciate the value of exploration, and how it can lead to new discoveries and experiences. Most importantly, it has helped me to appreciate the value of friendship, and how it can be forged through shared experiences and challenges.
